    irony in the play, and pay close attention to the relationships

**4.2.3 Elizabethan Theatre and Class Relations** <span
id="4.2.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: Bartleby’s version of William Shakespeare’s *Hamlet***
    Link: Bartleby’s version of William Shakespeare’s
    [*Hamlet*](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/William-Shakespeare-Hamlet.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Shakespeare’s *Hamlet*. As one of William
    Shakespeare’s most famous dramatic tragedies, *Hamlet* explores
    themes of treachery, incest, and moral corruption, and it has been
    the inspiration for innumerable adaptations and even
    psychoanalytical theories. Pay close attention to Hamlet’s shifting
    thoughts and emotions. Take note of how Hamlet develops as a
    personality and character throughout the play. Consider how he
    attempts to reconcile his father’s death, and his mother’s and
    uncle’s actions. Take notice of his treatment of Ophelia and the
    soliloquies he delivers throughout the play. Give careful
    consideration to Hamlet’s viewpoint on the meaning of life and
    death. As you read the play, pay close attention to the language
    that is used and the manner in which Hamlet considers not only the
    meaning of life and the purpose of his existence but also his wry
    and sometimes cutting – and darkly humorous – observations on
    life.  
      
     Terms of Use: *Hamlet* is in the public domain.

**4.2.4 Why is Hamlet a Tragedy?** <span id="4.2.4"></span> 
*The answer to this question may seem obvious, but as you will recall
from your reading in subunit 4.2.1, tragedy can be defined by language
and characters as much as plot.*

-   **Activity: Critical Essay**
    Instructions: Print out and annotate Dr. Mike Webster’s essay
    “Tragedy, the Basics.” Then, return to Hamlet and take notes on any
    parts of the play that either support or refute the play’s status as
    a tragedy. Afterwards, write a 1.5-page critical essay in which you
    explain why or why not Hamlet should be categorized as a tragedy.

**4.3.2 Post-Modern Drama** <span id="4.3.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Samuel-Beckett.net’s version of Samuel Beckett’s *Waiting
    for Godot***

    Link: Samuel-Beckett.net’s version of Samuel Beckett’s [*Waiting for
    Godot*](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Waiting-for-Godot.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Acts I and II of Beckett’s play. There is a link
    to move on to Act II at the very bottom of the Act I page.  
      
     Subtitled a “tragicomedy in two acts,” *Waiting for* *Godot* is
    Samuel Beckett’s Post-Modern incarnation of the dramatic form. In
    the play, Beckett challenges dramatic conventions and denies the
    viewers’ expectations, leaving his work open to a number of varied
    interpretations. The play is widely considered to be a profound
    meditation on the meaning of life and the absurd nature of existence
    in the modern world. The meaning(s) of the play can be found not in
    the actions that occur but instead within the discussions – which
    are often circular and seemingly pointless – between the
    characters.  
      
     Consider the following study questions: What might Godot symbolize
    in this play?  Why does Godot never arrive?  
      
     Terms of Use: *Waiting for Godot* is in the public domain.

**4.3.3 Theater Culture Today** <span id="4.3.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Saylor Foundation’s “Introduction to Postmodern
    Western Theater”**

    Theater”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/SAYLOR.ORG-ENGL101-POSTMODERNTHEATER.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read the brief entry on Postmodern Western theater.
    As you read, consider the following questions: What are some of the
    major differences between Modern and Post-Modern theater?  What are
    some of the most common attributes of Post-Modern theater?
