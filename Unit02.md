**Unit 2: Poetics** <span id="2"></span> 
*After the discovery of “The Epic of Gilgamesh,” we learned that poetry
has been around since the third millennium, BCE (and likely well before
that), and that it has survived, in one form or another, in every
society since. But what is poetry? What distinguishes it from other
forms of literary expression? In this unit, we will seek to clarify
these questions by acquainting ourselves with the principle modes,
styles, and elements of poetry in English. Along the way, we will read
and explicate a number of the most widely anthologized poems in the
English tradition, including poems by authors as varied as William
Shakespeare and W. H. Auden.*

**2.1.3 Poetry and Society** <span id="2.1.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: Project Gutenberg’s version of Aristotle’s *Poetics*:
    “Sections I, II, III, and IV”, and Bartleby’s version of Percy
    Bysshe Shelley’s “A Defence of Poetry”**

    Link: Project Gutenberg’s version of Aristotle’s *Poetics:*
    [“Sections I, II, III, and
    IV”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/THE-POETICS-OF-ARISTOTLE.pdf) (PDF),
    and Bartleby’s version of Percy Bysshe Shelley’s [“A Defence of
    Poetry”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/A-Defense-of-Poetry.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Scroll down and read only sections I, II, III, and IV
    of *Poetics*. In this essay, written in 335 B.C.E., Aristotle argues
    that poetry is, essentially, a form of imitation and that humans
    enjoy and learn from artistic mimicry. It is widely thought that
    *Poetics* is a response to Aristotle’s teacher, Plato, who argued in
    *The Republic* that poets should be banished, because they portray a
    false image of the world.  
      

    Then read Shelley’s Romantic-era essay concerning the ways in which
    poetry should be defined and understood. This essay was written in
    1821 and published in 1840. Like Aristotle, Shelley argues that
    poetry reflects a desire to reproduce rhythm, harmony, and beauty.
    Taking this argument one step further, Shelley believes that poets
    are visionaries who can order the world in new ways and positively
    influence civil society. According to Shelley, “Poets are the
    unacknowledged legislators of the
    world”[<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>](http://www.bartleby.com/27/23.html)  
      
     Consider the following study questions: What does Aristotle
    consider to be the primary social function of literature? How does
    Shelley directly or implicitly rework some of Aristotle’s ideas?
    What is the status of poets and poetry in today’s society?  
      
     Terms of Use: Aristotle’s *Poetics* and “A Defence of Poetry” are
    both in the public domain.

    1–10 of his “Song of Myself” in order to gain a sense of the
    difference between stanzaic versus continuous poetic forms.  
      
     Many literary critics and historians feel that Whitman was
    America’s first great poet. Whitman’s poetry is full of passion and
    personal expression, yet he also focuses on democracy and equality
    of the American people. Many contemporary American poets consider
    Whitman to be the greatest American poet of the nineteenth century
    and in possession of a remarkable and engaging measure of humanity
    and personal insight. “O Captain, My Captain” is an elegy written
    after the assassination of President Lincoln. “Song of Myself” is a
    celebration of Whitman’s self and through him, the self of all
    others. In essence, Whitman expressed vox populi, or the voice of
    the people.  
      
     Terms of Use: “O Captain, My Captain” and “Song of Myself” are both
    in the public domain.

**2.4.5 Narrative Poetry** <span id="2.4.5"></span> 
*Narrative poems are poems that tell stories.  They are among the most
ancient forms of storytelling and were often recited aloud or set to
music.  Homer’s* Odyssey*, Virgil’s* Aeneid*, and Chaucer’s* Canterbury
Tales* are all examples of narrative poems.  In the following subunit,
you will examine two famous examples of narrative poems.*

     Instructions: Read Coleridge’s poem (and its accompanying gloss)
    and Book 9 of Milton’s epic poem.  Note that Book 9 of Milton’s
    “*Paradise Lost”* is an example of epic poetry, which is a subgenre
    of narrative poetry.  
      
     Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s “The *Rime of the Ancient Mariner”* is
    widely considered to be one of the greatest epic poems of the
    English Romantic age. This richly symbolic story of the ancient
    mariner, who is seemingly cursed for killing the albatross and his
    resulting encounters with death in a variety of different forms, and
    left to forever wander and tell his story, is a richly allegorical
    and philosophical tale. The accompanying gloss notes – which were
    written by Coleridge after his composition of the original draft of
    the poem itself – serve to expand on a number of themes presented
    within the text and provide another set of ideas and a separate
    perspective on the events that occur within the poem.  
      
     John Milton’s “*Paradise Lost”* is considered to be the greatest
    English epic poem. Over the course of the poem’s 10 books, Milton
    chronicles and reworks the Christian story of the fall of man in
    order, as he stated, to “justify the ways of God to man.” Milton
    explores a range of topics throughout the poem, including politics,
    faith, fate, and the nature of good and evil. In Book 9, which is
    presented here, Milton explores Adam and Eve’s act of disobedience
    in the Garden of Eden and their fall from God’s grace.  
      
     Terms of Use: “*Paradise Lost”* and “The Rime of the Ancient
    Mariner” are both in the public domain.

**2.4.6 Dramatic Poetry** <span id="2.4.6"></span> 
*Dramatic poetry, as its name implies, is a poem that is intended to be
enacted in a theater or that is written in the style of a play or the
voice of a character speaking aloud. For example, Shakespeare’s plays
are written as extended dramatic poems, and his characters speak to one
another in verse. Some dramatic poems are never intended to be enacted
but rather adopt the style of a live conversation or monologue. Robert
Browning and Alfred, Lord Tennyson are among the best-known for this
style of dramatic poem.  The genre of dramatic poetry sometimes overlaps
with narrative poetry. For example, Chaucer’s* Canterbury Tales *is
often considered an extended narrative poem; however, much of the story
is told through dramatic monologue and dialogue. *

    William Shakespeare's *A Midsummer Night's Dream*: Act 1, Scene 1**
    Link: Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s version of William
    Shakespeare's [*A Midsummer Night's Dream: Act 1, Scene
    1*](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ENGL-101-2.4.6_A-Midsummer-Nights-Dream-Act-I-Scene-I.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Act 1, Scene 1, of Shakespeare’s play for a
    classic example of the genre.  
      
     Shakespeare’s *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* is probably his most
    famous comedic play. The plot of the play involves the festivities
    surrounding the marriage of the Duke of Athens and Queen of the
    Amazons, a group of actors, two pairs of lovers, and the
    manipulations of a group of fairies who reside within the forest in
    which the play is set. The play is considered by many critics to be
    Shakespeare’s most inventive, subtle, and complicated work. In the
    first scene of the play, which you will read here, the Duke of
    Athens and Queen of the Amazons discuss their impending marriage
    and, among a variety of other topics, the nature of love.  
      
     Terms of Use: *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* is in the public domain.

     Instructions: Play the audio recording at the top of the page and
    read the poem as you listen.  
      
     Consider the following study question: Why does Browning write his
    poem in a dramatic form?  How is the poem’s effect different from
    that of a narrative poem?
