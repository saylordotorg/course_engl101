**Unit 1: Text and Discourse** <span id="1"></span> 
*If you read regularly, you probably have a good sense of what kind of
literature you like and what you don’t like. However, if you are like
most readers, you may not know why you react in the ways you do or how,
exactly, writing works to elicit these reactions from you. Many forms of
literature, from novels to poems to plays, create a world and draw
readers into this world. When we like what we are reading, we can get
lost in this world. We may lose track of time, lose track of where we
are, and lose control of our emotions. When this happens, our critical
faculties are turned off.  By contrast, when we analyze literature and
try to understand our reactions to it, we must turn our critical
faculties on. In order to do this, we have to take a step back from the
story we are reading to look at how it is constructed and for what
purpose. In the following unit, you will learn about several styles of
literary criticism that are all designed to give readers a critical
perspective on what they read. Each critical style is designed to help
readers adopt a new critical perspective, so that they can gain a deeper
understanding of how the piece is created, what it means, and why
readers react to it in the ways they do.*

        reading.
    -   Chapter 6: At the beginning of this chapter, Fry discusses
        Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, German critics who argued
        that popular literature and art are created by a “culture
        industry” that creates artwork in much the same way as
        factory-made products are mass produced. Products of the culture
        industry encourage audiences to passively consume art and make
        them susceptible to easy manipulation.
    -   Chapter 7: In this chapter, Fry discusses the theories of Walter
        Benjamin, another German critic sometimes associated with
        Marxist criticism. Unlike Adorno and Horkheimer, Benjamin
        believed that popular art forms had some redeeming qualities and
        could help audiences recognize and even subvert the controls of
        ideology.
