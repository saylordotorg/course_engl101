**Unit 3: Narrativity and the Novel** <span id="3"></span> 
*In the preface to his novel,* The Ambassadors*, Henry James once
described novels as “the most independent, the most elastic, the most
prodigious of literary forms.” With this high praise in mind, we will
begin to examine this most popular of literary forms, from the reasons
for its emergence in the first half of the eighteenth century to the
mechanics of its construction. We will also acquaint ourselves with a
variety of novelistic conventions and subgenres, recognizing – to quote
James – the novel’s elasticity and range as a form. By the end of this
unit, we will have developed an appreciation for the novel’s distinctive
features – that is, what makes a novel a novel – and will be capable of
both comprehending and discussing a novel at a high level, with the help
of critical terms and theories.*
