This course will introduce you to the history and practice of English as
a scholarly discipline with the goal of preparing you for your future
endeavors as an English major. It has been designed to familiarize you
with the various tools that scholars have devised in order to facilitate
the study of literary expression in English, from critical frameworks to
close reading techniques. After an introductory unit outlining basic
approaches to literary analysis, we will embark upon a genre study,
devoting each of the four remaining units to a different genre of
writing: poetry, the novel, drama, the rhetorical essay, and the
critical essay. In each of these units, we will review a general history
of the genre, read a representative sample or set of samples, learn
genre-specific critical terms and theories, and apply what you have
learned to essays of your own. By the end of this course, you will have
developed strategies that will enable you to understand, analyze, and
critically respond to works in any genre at an advanced level.

    Tutorials”](http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/virtualit/default.asp?uid=0&rau=0)

-   University of Pennsylvania: Dr. Al Filreis’s [“English 88: Modern
    and Contemporary American Poetry
    Homepage”](http://writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/home.html)
-   Open Yale Courses: Paul Fry’s *Introduction to the Theory of
    Literature*: [“Introduction to Literary
    Theory”](http://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300)

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
latter units. You will also need to complete:  

-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the materials in each unit. Responding to the questions
that follow each of the assigned readings as you take notes will help
you prepare for the Final Exam.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of **130
hours** to complete. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should
help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and determine how much time you have over the next
few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for yourself. For
example, subunit 1.2 should take you 12.5 hours. Perhaps you can sit
down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.2.1 (a total of
1 hour) on Monday, subunit 1.2.2 (a total of 1 hour) on Tuesday, subunit
1.2.3 (a total of 2 hours) on Wednesday, and so forth.
