**Unit 5: Rhetoric and the Critical Essay** <span id="5"></span> 
*As you have discovered by now, literary criticism requires you to
carefully read and analyze literary texts. It also requires you to
develop a convincing argument that encourages readers to view a piece of
writing in a new way. The best literary criticism can become a form of
literature in its own right.*  
  
 *Most literary criticism is written in the form of an essay, which is a
piece of writing that makes an argument and that uses rhetorical
devices, techniques intended to convince and persuade readers or members
of an audience. The study of rhetoric first began in ancient Greece, and
rhetoric is still an important foundation for writers of all genres
today.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will encounter several examples of literary essays,
which are intended to reinforce many of the concepts you learned in the
previous units. You will also learn how to conduct a meta-analysis of
literary criticism. In other words, you will learn how to analyze and
critique the essays that critique literature.*

**5.1.3 How Texts Interact: Engaging with Discourse** <span

-   **Reading: University of Illinois at Chicago: Gerald Graff’s *They
    Say, I Say*: “Introduction”**

    Link: University of Illinois at Chicago: Gerald Graff’s *They Say, I
    Say*:
    [“Introduction”](http://tigger.uic.edu/~ggraff/Gerald_Graff,_Ph.D./home.html) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Gerald Graff's introduction to *They Say, I
    Say*, which can be found by following the link to Graff's home page
    and clicking on the yellow circle that says  “read the introduction
    here.” In the book,* *Graff claims that academic argument is a
    dialogue in which the author recognizes what others are saying while
    making space for his own thoughts in that discourse. It is a useful
    introduction to the “academic moves” that experts make in crafting
    their arguments.  
      
     Consider the following study question: According to Graff, how do
    literary texts interact with each other?

**5.2 The Critical Essay** <span id="5.2"></span> 
*Note: In each of the following essays for this subunit, we will
encounter a different critical approach to the same text, William
Shakespeare’s* Hamlet*, which we read in Unit 4.  We will identify
critical approaches, examine discursive practices, and attempt to
evaluate the relative success of each.*

**5.2.1 Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s “Lectures and Notes on Shakespeare”**
<span id="5.2.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s “Lectures and Notes on
    Shakespeare”**
    Link: Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s [“Lectures and Notes on
    Shakespeare”](http://shakespearean.org.uk/ham1-col.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read Coleridge’s lecture on *Hamlet.* The article
    begins after the parenthetical remarks with the sentence that begins
    “The seeming inconsistencies…” Coleridge was the romantic poet who
    wrote “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” which you read earlier in
    this course. He was also an influential literary critic. His
    criticism often combines logical argument with an interest in his
    own emotions, and those of the characters he studies.  
      
     Consider the following study questions: Coleridge is writing in
    1818, well before the schools of literary criticism discussed in
    Unit 3. Which schools of criticism do you think Coleridge
    influenced? Why? What rhetorical strategies does Coleridge use? Do
    you notice any similarities between the writing style used in The
    Rime of the Ancient Mariner and the writing style of this essay?
